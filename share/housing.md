# Hey there!

I just got to San Francisco and I'm very interested in the room you are currently renting. Here is some short presentation about my self.

My name is Pedro Matias, I'm 23 years old. I'm going to intern as a software engineer at a [tech startup](http://thousandeyes.com) in SF until early September (this is the plan at the moment).

During my years of university, I have been sharing flats with other people, so I understand the importance of respect and commitment towards flatmates. I don't smoke and I appreciate cleanliness and organization, so I try to live with that in mind!

Here is a pic of me:

I'm from Portugal where I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. After that, I moved to Sweden where I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science. I like mathematics and logic, but I'm also a big fan of sports -- football, running, swimming, cycling, etc. I like to hangout with friends and I'm outgoing. I also like music and I play the guitar occasionally.
