Life is awesome. I like many things in Life. For instance, I like Theoretical Computer Science, challenges and puzzles. I also like to learn new stuff and build things. This blog is going to help me collect and share all this cool stuff!

Probably, you will see many posts about a particular intriguing problem in Computer Science! Such problems might come, for example, from programming contests, research papers, or pretty much anywhere, as long as they keep me awaken at night. I will also publish topics on TCS which I find too fascinating to be left alone unnoticed. These will mostly be related to algorithms and combinatorial optimisation and they might arise from places like [1] or [2].

Hope you enjoy and stay tuned!
