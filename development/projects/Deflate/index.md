Deflate
================

Implementation of the [Deflate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE) algorithm for decompressing gzip files. Deflate is a data compression algorithm that uses [Adaptive Huffman Coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) on top of [LZ77](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78): the implemented Huffman trees encode the "encoding" given by LZ77.

*Language*: C++
