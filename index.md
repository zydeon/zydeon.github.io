Welcome to my personal website. I'm currently a Computer Science student at [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se).

My main interests are algorithms and mathematics. I'm also a big fan of functional programming.

Check out what I've been doing both in [development](/development) and [research](/research).
