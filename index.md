I just earned my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [Chalmers University of Technology](http://www.chalmers.se).

I like algorithms and mathematics and I'm a big fan of functional programming.

Check out what I've been doing under [development](/development) and [research](/research), or on my [blog](http://blog.pmatias.com).
