We apply it to a diverse class of geometric problems: we construct the greedy multi-fragment tour for Euclidean TSP in $O(n\\log n)$ time in any fixed dimension and for Steiner TSP in planar graphs in $O(n\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$ time; we compute motorcycle graphs (which are a central part in straight skeleton algorithms) in $O(n^{4/3+\\epsilon})$ time for any $\\epsilon0$; we introduce a narcissistic variant of the $k$-attribute stable matching model, and solve it in $O(n^{2-4/(k(1+\\epsilon)+2)})$ time; we give a linear-time $2$-approximation for a 1D geometric set cover problem with applications to radio station placement.","tags":[],"title":"Euclidean TSP, Motorcycle Graphs, and Other New Applications of Nearest-Neighbor Chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Eppstein","Michael T.

[3]. Given an undirected graph with a source $s$ and a destination $t$, find the smallest subset of vertices whose intersection with any $s−t$ path results in a unique sequence. In this paper, we show that this problem remains NP-complete when the graph is planar and we give a $4$-approximation algorithm in this setting. We also show, via Courcelle's theorem, that it can be solved in linear time for graphs of bounded-clique width, when its clique decomposition is given in advance.","tags":[],"title":"Tracking Paths in Planar Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luís Paquete","Pedro Matias","Maryam Abbasi","Miguel Pinheiro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"3ab4673aa097f51c41b82d7a3d64e147","permalink":"/publication/2013-mosal2/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T00:00:34.875727Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-mosal2/","section":"publication","summary":": Multiobjective sequence alignment brings the advantage of providing a set of alignments that represent the trade-off between performing insertion/deletions and matching symbols from both sequences.

Moreover, we present a method for the construction of phylogenetic trees based on this bicriteria framework. Two exemplary cases are discussed. Results: Numerical results on a real dataset show that this approach is very fast in practice. The pruning technique saves up to 90% in memory usage and 80% in CPU time. Based on this method, phylogenetic trees are constructed from real-life data. In addition of providing complementary information, some of these trees match those obtained by the Maximum Likelihood method. Availability and implementation: Source code is freely available for download at URL http://eden.dei.uc.pt/paquete/MOSAL, implemented in C and supported on Linux, MAC OS and MS Windows.","tags":null,"title":"Improvements on bicriteria pairwise sequence alignment: Algorithms and applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"021619127fc6d2ae48d7bb0344bef8cc","permalink":"/industry/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/industry/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
