We apply it to a diverse class of geometric problems: we construct the greedy multi-fragment tour for Euclidean TSP in $O(n\\log n)$ time in any fixed dimension and for Steiner TSP in planar graphs in $O(n\\sqrt{n}\\log n)$ time; we compute motorcycle graphs (which are a central part in straight skeleton algorithms) in $O(n^{4/3+\\epsilon})$ time for any $\\epsilon0$; we introduce a narcissistic variant of the $k$-attribute stable matching model, and solve it in $O(n^{2-4/(k(1+\\epsilon)+2)})$ time; we give a linear-time $2$-approximation for a 1D geometric set cover problem with applications to radio station placement.","tags":[],"title":"Euclidean TSP, Motorcycle Graphs, and Other New Applications of Nearest-Neighbor Chains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Eppstein","Michael T.

[3]. Given an undirected graph with a source $s$ and a destination $t$, find the smallest subset of vertices whose intersection with any $sâˆ’t$ path results in a unique sequence. In this paper, we show that this problem remains NP-complete when the graph is planar and we give a 4-approximation algorithm in this setting. We also show, via Courcelle's theorem, that it can be solved in linear time for graphs of bounded-clique width, when its clique decomposition is given in advance.","tags":[],"title":"Tracking Paths in Planar Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"021619127fc6d2ae48d7bb0344bef8cc","permalink":"/industry/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/industry/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
